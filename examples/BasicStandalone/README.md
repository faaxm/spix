# Example: BasicStandalone

This example has the same code as the 'Basic' example, but is designed as a standalone project. You can use it as a template to use Spix in your own project.
Since this example is a standalone project, it is not built as part of the "Spix" project.

After installing Spix, you can build this example like this:
```shell
cd examples/BasicStandalone
mkdir build
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
```
